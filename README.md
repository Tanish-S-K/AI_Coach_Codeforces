# ⚡ Codeforces AI Coach

> A full-stack web app that analyzes your Codeforces performance and delivers personalized AI coaching based on your real contest history.

---

## 📋 Project Summary

- **Built a Codeforces analytics dashboard** that fetches live user data via the Codeforces public API and visualizes rating history, weekly problem-solving activity, difficulty distribution, and topic coverage using interactive charts (Area, Bar, Radar).
- **Engineered a per-contest AI coaching engine** powered by Google Gemini (gemini-2.5-flash) that ingests a user's last N contests — including solved/upsolved/unsolved problems, accuracy, timing, and rating deltas — and generates personalized, paragraph-style improvement advice for each contest.
- **Delivered a responsive React frontend** with four distinct pages (Dashboard, Contests, Problems, AI Advice) that communicate with a Flask REST API backend, featuring server-side caching to avoid redundant Codeforces API calls and a clean dark-themed UI.

## 📦 Dependencies

### Backend (Python)

Install with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `flask` | Web framework & REST API server |
| `flask-cors` | Allow cross-origin requests from the React frontend |
| `flask-caching` | Server-side in-memory caching for CF API responses |
| `requests` | HTTP calls to the Codeforces public API |
| `google-genai` | Google Gemini AI SDK for generating coaching advice |
| `python-dotenv` | Load `GEMINI_API_KEY` from the `.env` file |

### Frontend (Node.js)

Install with:
```bash
npm install
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `react` + `react-dom` | UI framework |
| `recharts` | Charts — Area, Bar, Radar, and more |
| `vite` | Dev server & bundler |

---

## 🔑 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file inside the `src/` folder:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
```

Get your free Gemini API key at: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

## 🚀 How to Run

You need **two terminals** running simultaneously — one for the backend, one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1 — Start the Flask Backend

```bash
cd project/src
pip install -r requirements.txt      # first time only
python main.py
```

Flask will start at `http://localhost:5000`

### Terminal 2 — Start the React Frontend

```bash
cd project/frontend
npm install                          # first time only
npm run dev
```

Frontend will start at `http://localhost:5173`

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser, type any Codeforces handle, and hit **Analyze**.

## 🖥️ Pages

| Page | What it shows |
|------|--------------|
| **Dashboard** | Profile card, rating over time, weekly grind chart, difficulty distribution, top tags bar chart, topic radar |
| **Contests** | Full contest history table — rank, rating change, division, problems solved |
| **Problems** | Searchable + filterable list of every problem solved, with difficulty color coding |
| **AI Advice** | Per-contest accordion cards with metrics, problem breakdowns, and AI coach paragraphs |

## ⚙️ How the AI Coaching Works

1. The backend fetches the user's last 3 contests from Codeforces
2. For each contest, it calculates: problems solved/upsolved/unsolved, first AC time, accuracy, rating delta, tags covered, and difficulty range
3. All of this is packed into a structured prompt and sent to **Gemini 2.5 Flash**
4. The AI responds with coach-style paragraph advice — no bullet lists, just natural language
5. The frontend splits that advice across the contest cards so each contest gets its own coaching section
6. Results are cached for 1 hour so the AI isn't called on every page refresh

---

## 📝 Notes

- The Codeforces API is public and requires no key — but it rate-limits heavy traffic, so caching is important
- The AI Advice page can take **10–20 seconds** to load on first fetch since Gemini needs to process a large prompt
- Clicking **Refresh Analysis** on the AI page bypasses the cache and re-generates fresh advice
- The frontend proxies all `/user/...` API calls to Flask via Vite's `server.proxy` config, so no CORS issues in development
